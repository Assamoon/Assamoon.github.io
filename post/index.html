            <p>The Witcher 3 is an excellent RPG game; the studio revealed The Witcher 3&rsquo;s sales numbers topped 28 million by the end of 2019. The Witcher 3 was recognized as game of the year by IGN, GameSpot, Game Informer and other gaming publications. The game received a Golden Joystick Award for Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, and Best Gaming Moment, and The Game Awards for Best Role-Playing Game and Studio of the Year for CD Projekt Red. It is most praised is its story and immersive experience, so we want to analyze the characters and bestiaries in Wikipedia so we can know what kind of world CDPR builds.</p>

            <p>The game is famous and has catalyzed many communities. However, to limit the scope of the project, the data that will be used is from two sources. The original data comes from [Wikipedia][https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki], which is the main source of this project. We extract 730 characters and 121 monsters from &ldquo;The Witcher 3&rdquo; and its DLCs (Downloadable content, is additional content created for an already released video game). Another dataset is from [Transcripts Fandom][https://transcripts.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher], which contains the dialog from TV series &ldquo;The Witcher&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>The network consists with 787 nodes and 1514 edges which contains all the creatures included both characters and bestiaries. Each character has different attributes, such as race, profession, nationality, etc. Monsters have eleven categories, such as Elementa, Hybrids, and their respective locations. Some characters are also belongs to bestiaries, that&rsquo;s why the nodes is 787 rather than 730 + 121 = 851.</p>
<p><img src="https://assamoon.github.io/images/output2.png" alt="output2"></p>
<p>These graph shows a little more variety, but most of the nodes from this subset of nodes with a degree higher than 5 have a degree lower than around 50. Higher than that are just a handful of nodes. The main characters, Geralt and Yennefer takes account for the most links.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the world of The Witcher 3, the conflict between humans and monsters occupies most of the chapter. In the game, the player often encounters the choice of whether to favor non-human creatures or humans. Which side to choose to help? Kind monsters or malicious human beings. The choices made by the players have different consequences.

we can see radanian has most types of bestiary, you can check the information of Radanian. <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Redania">https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Redania</a>.
In the game, Redania controls most of the northern region, and the independent city of Novigrad in the west is also deeply affected. As a country in war, its border areas have lost control, which is why Various monsters appeared. It proves that the analyzed data corresponds to the background of the story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the blood simple(Toussaint) has  the second most monster type , but this is only because this is the content of the DLC and is an additional map. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt â€” Blood and Wine expansion pack has won the award for Best Role Playing Game in 2016, yes a DLC won the award.
If you want players to get a good experience in the DLC, you need to add enough content to the DLC. Obviously, compared with the number of bestiary in game itself, the Witcher 3 blood and wine content is rich enough.</p>

The two happiest people are Merchant (Blandare) and Merchant (Larvik), both merchants. Their nationality are both skellige.And We can see that the Grossbar brothers are all on the list and their nationality is also skellige. 
<img src="https://assamoon.github.io/images/grossbar.png" alt="topology">
This shows that the residents of skellige at least expressed more happiness in their lines.</p>

<p>The two saddest people are  prison warden and dirk
An unnamed Prison Warden was a high-ranking official of the witch hunters who presided over Deireadh prison and commanded its garrison until 1272
Dirk was a cruel and sadistic torturer who worked for the witch hunters.One of his favorite ways to torture mages was taking a fingernail, or as he said, &ldquo;better three&rdquo;. He died when Geralt and Triss destroyed the witch hunters' outpost in Novigrad in 1272.
There must be many sad stories in this prison, right?</p>
