            <p>Which characters use the <strong>most words</strong> in total?</p>
<p><img src="https://assamoon.github.io/images/dialog_words_counts.png" alt="dialog_words_counts"></p>
<p>Geralt and Yennefer should be the main characters, but their sentence is short corresponding to their characteristic: very decisive and executive. While Jaskie, the green bar, he is a poet, minstrel, bard, and Geralt&rsquo;s best friend. Obviously his constant chatter did live up to his career, which is why he was hated by Geralt in the first place. The blue one is Stregobor, a magic, who likes to say something unfathomable, like riddles, which is complicated and annoying.</p>
<p>What is the <strong>overall sentiment</strong> in the first five episodes?</p>
<p><img src="https://assamoon.github.io/images/sentiment_pie_chart.png" alt="sentiment_pie_chart"></p>
<p>What is the <strong>sentiment in lines said out by different characters</strong>?</p>
<p><img src="https://assamoon.github.io/images/dialog_sentiment.png" alt="dialog_sentiment"></p>
<p><strong>Geralt of Rivia</strong>,  a legendary witcher, is experienced and always acts alone. His words are mostly neural, which is in line with people&rsquo;s stereotype of the witcher in this world, cold-blooded and ruthless.  As can be seen, neutral sentiment dominates, except for Jaskier. He’s more positive than other characters and it is sensible in the series. That&rsquo;s why Geralt was bored with him at the beginning but treated him as best friend afterwards - he is a rare optimist in this cruel world.</p>

<p>The stories, connections, and conflicts between Geralt and characters from other races. It is also why the Witcher 3 game is rich in content and more immersive.We use word clouds to analyze high-frequency words of different races, their characteristics and their connections with Geralt.

<blockquote>
<p>We can see in the word cloud of human ,the words: human and humans have the highest frequency. Therefore, the word human is frequently mentioned in game lines, and Geralt is an alien among humans. To monsters, a witcher is a human being. To humans, a witcher is more like a freak.The most frequently occurring words among the other three races are the main characters of that race. This, on the other hand, reflects that the world of The Witcher 3 is a world dominated by humans, and other races are supporting roles in the story. This is also similar to the setting of the Witcher world.<br>
In the word cloud of dwarves, we can see armor, which is consistent with most dwarves appearing in the game being blacksmiths. In the word cloud of elves, the biggest word is Eredin, he was known to most as the King of the Wild Hunt.we can also find the two keywords wild and hunt, which shows that the main villain in this game belongs to the elves.  As a special race, vampires belong to the wisdom race and the monster type. We can see friend from the word cloud, which is related to the important vampire character Dettlaf in DLC Blood and Wine, and it is also Geralt’s friend.
In the frequency analysis of the word cloud, we can see the relationship between the other three races and the human race to which the protagonist belongs. The main elves are enemies, while the dwarves provide weapons and armor. There are fewer vampires, but they are always related to Blood, beasts, and tall.</p>

<p>From the above analysis, we can find that the background story and settings of The Witcher 3 are related to the performance of the characters in the game and the distribution of monsters. This also proves that building a game world in which the lines and stories are not inconsistent can greatly improve the player&rsquo;s sense of immersion.</p>
