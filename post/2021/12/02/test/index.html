<p>The stories, connections, and conflicts between Geralt and characters from other races. It is also why the Witcher 3 game is rich in content and more immersive.We use word clouds to analyze high-frequency words of different races, their characteristics and their connections with Geralt.

<blockquote>
<p>We can see in the word cloud of human ,the words: human and humans have the highest frequency. Therefore, the word human is frequently mentioned in game lines, and Geralt is an alien among humans. To monsters, a witcher is a human being. To humans, a witcher is more like a freak.The most frequently occurring words among the other three races are the main characters of that race. This, on the other hand, reflects that the world of The Witcher 3 is a world dominated by humans, and other races are supporting roles in the story. This is also similar to the setting of the Witcher world.<br>
In the word cloud of dwarves, we can see armor, which is consistent with most dwarves appearing in the game being blacksmiths. In the word cloud of elves, the biggest word is Eredin, he was known to most as the King of the Wild Hunt.we can also find the two keywords wild and hunt, which shows that the main villain in this game belongs to the elves.  As a special race, vampires belong to the wisdom race and the monster type. We can see friend from the word cloud, which is related to the important vampire character Dettlaf in DLC Blood and Wine, and it is also Geraltâ€™s friend.
In the frequency analysis of the word cloud, we can see the relationship between the other three races and the human race to which the protagonist belongs. The main elves are enemies, while the dwarves provide weapons and armor. There are fewer vampires, but they are always related to Blood, beasts, and tall.</p>
